## Key Features

- **Team-Based PvP Action**: Collaborate with your team to outmaneuver and outsmart your opponents in dynamic, adrenaline-fueled matches.

- **King of the Hill Mode**:
  - Focuses on a single control point at the center of the map, which is neutral and locked at the beginning of the round.
  - Teams must make their way to the control point and capture it when it becomes available.
  - Once the point is captured by a team, their team clock will start a three-minute countdown.
  - If the enemy team manages to capture the point back, their clock will start counting down while the other team's clock freezes at the time the point was recaptured.
  - A team wins once they own the point and their clock runs down to zero.
